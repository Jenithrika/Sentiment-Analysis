**Sentiment Analysis Using Textual Reviews**
**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing sentiment from textual reviews using machine learning techniques. The pipeline involves comprehensive text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification, resulting in a model capable of effectively identifying sentiment labels.

**Key Features**
**Text Preprocessing:**
1. Processed over 1,000 textual reviews, including cleaning, tokenization, and stemming to refine the dataset.
2. Enhanced data quality by removing noise such as special characters, stopwords, and irrelevant elements.

**Feature Engineering:**
1. Converted textual data into numerical features using the Bag of Words model.
2. Selected the top 1,500 most frequent terms for efficient representation and dimensionality reduction.

**Model Implementation:**
1. Built a Naive Bayes classifier to classify sentiments into predefined categories.
2. Achieved an accuracy of 73%, precision of 68%, and an F1 score of 0.77.
